# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "When I read about the Ten Years Challenge, it was a matter of seconds to decide to participate in the contest with the replication of a work on the numerical simulation of a Josephson junction driven by a train of microwave pulses.
The experience has been exceptionally instructive and all considered much easier than I initially thought.
The paper describes the tools and tricks used for the replication and the lessons learned from this work.
Among them, keeping good and detailed documentation and using of tools and languages that do not fall into oblivion after one or two releases."
