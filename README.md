## Contents of this repository

The directory [`article`](https://github.com/sabinomaggi/ten-years-challenge-pulsed-drive/tree/submission/article) contains the LaTeX sources and the figures of the article submitted to ReScience, together with the generated pdf file.

The directory [`code`](https://github.com/sabinomaggi/ten-years-challenge-pulsed-drive/tree/submission/code) contains all the source and data files mentioned in the article. 
In particular, the Fortran source files are in [`code/mccumber`](https://github.com/sabinomaggi/ten-years-challenge-pulsed-drive/tree/submission/code/mccumber), together with the corresponding binaries for macOS compiled with `gfortran`, the Visual Basic 1.0 project is in [`code/vbprogs`](https://github.com/sabinomaggi/ten-years-challenge-pulsed-drive/tree/submission/code/vbprogs) and the configuration and output data files are in [`code/2020runs`](https://github.com/sabinomaggi/ten-years-challenge-pulsed-drive/tree/submission/code/2020runs).

The directory [`original_code`](https://github.com/sabinomaggi/ten-years-challenge-pulsed-drive/tree/submission/original_code) contains the original Fortran and Visual Basic 1.0 source files mentioned in the article.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to add the image of the virtual machine used to run the Visual Basic project since it contains proprietary software. However, the virtual machine can be easily rebuild by following the information contained in the article.
