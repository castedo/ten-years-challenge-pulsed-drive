## Contents of this repository

The directory [`article`](https://github.com/sabinomaggi/ten-years-challenge-pulsed-drive/tree/submission/article) contains the LaTeX sources and the figures of the article submitted to ReScience, together with the generated pdf file.

The directory [`code`](https://github.com/sabinomaggi/ten-years-challenge-pulsed-drive/tree/submission/code) contains all the source and data files mentioned in the article. 
In particular, the Fortran source files are in [`code/mccumber`](https://github.com/sabinomaggi/ten-years-challenge-pulsed-drive/tree/submission/code/mccumber), together with the corresponding binaries for macOS compiled with `gfortran`, the Visual Basic 1.0 project is in [`code/vbprogs`](https://github.com/sabinomaggi/ten-years-challenge-pulsed-drive/tree/submission/code/vbprogs) and the configuration and output data files are in [`code/2020runs`](https://github.com/sabinomaggi/ten-years-challenge-pulsed-drive/tree/submission/code/2020runs).

All instructions to compile and run the source code are available in the submitted paper.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to add the image of the virtual machine used to run the Visual Basic project since it contains proprietary software. However, the virtual machine can be easily rebuild by following the information contained in the article.
